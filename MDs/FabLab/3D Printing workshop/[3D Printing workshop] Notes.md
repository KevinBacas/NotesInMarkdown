# [3D Printing workshop] Notes
## Abstract
Make a 3D object from 3D file. this is achieved using an additive process where successive layers of material are laid down or fused together.

### Some methods
- FDM : Fused Deposition Modeling
- SLS : Selective Laser Sintering
  - Industrial one, because it's much more expensive
  - Pouder

- SLA : Stereolithography
  - Plastic very photosensitiv

- PP : Paper Based 3D Printing
- LOM : Laminated Object Manufacturing

### Process
- 3D model (.stl)
- Slicing Program
  - Translate to a language that the printer understand
  - Cartesian system

- 3D Printer

## Cura (**Slicing Programm**)
- Layer height : Resolution
- Shell : Wall thickness
- Fill density : Automatically filled
- Bed temperature : useful to maintain all the structure to the same temperature
