# [Plotter] Notes
## Abstract
In general we need vectors (So SVGs). **WE HAVE TO LEARN HOW TO USE ILLISTRATOR**. It uses a plugin that you can download on the FabLab's Website.

## Cutting Master
This is the software that will make a preview of the "print". It can also edit the settings before printing. It shows the size of the paper. It can load the size when we plug the plotter onto the computer.

A frame can be cut to remove easily useless parts.
